# Back end Practice Project: Employee CRUD Web Application
I made this project when I first started learning the Back-end in Web Development on ASP.NET.

I decided to make myself familiar with basic Back-end operations like Create, Read, Update, delete and decided to make this very bare Back-end Project. There is no CSS is used in this .NET Framework project, only the basic HTML table is used here.

This project is made on .NET Framework Webforms, and manually written SQL commands on IDE Visual Studio 2017. Here for making the local Server and Database, I used MS Sql Server Management Studio 2018.

In .NET Framework for web development, the ASP.NET Webforms can be used. Webforms have 2 parts: 
1) .aspx file where Front-end is written.
2) .cs file where the back-end is written in C# language.
